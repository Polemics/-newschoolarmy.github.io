        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy governs the use of software applications (“Applications”) developed by Polemics Applications LLC, including those branded under “New School Army.”
        </p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
            At Polemics Applications LLC and New School Army, we take privacy seriously. Our Army-related Applications (produced and showcased under the New School Army brand) are designed as educational references, utilities for enhancing the quality of life for Soldiers, or tools to assist with administrative tasks. We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal user data from these Applications.
        </p>

        <h2>User Provided Information</h2>
        <p>
            For New School Army Applications, no personal information is collected. Any data you enter into the Application (e.g., forms, notes, or other inputs) remains solely on your device and is never transmitted to us or shared with third parties. If an Application includes functionality that allows you to generate documents or emails from within the app, that information is only used locally within your device and not collected by us.
        </p>

        <h2>Automatically Collected Information</h2>
        <p>
            Our New School Army Applications do not automatically collect any information. This includes, but is not limited to, device identifiers, IP addresses, or geographic location. Any geolocation features offered are solely device-based, and no location data is transmitted or stored by us.
        </p>

        <h2>Location Information</h2>
        <p>
            Our Applications do not collect real-time location data. Some Applications may offer geolocation features for user convenience (e.g., maps), but all related data remains on the device and is discarded when you close the Application.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Access to Information</h2>
        <p>
            We do not provide third parties access to any data that may be entered or used within our Applications. Since we do not collect or store user data, no information is shared.
        </p>

        <h2>Opt-Out Rights</h2>
        <p>
            If you wish to discontinue any form of data usage (local to your device), you may simply uninstall the Application at any time. Because we do not collect or maintain your data, there is no additional opt-out mechanism required.
        </p>

        <h2>Data Retention Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Since no data is collected, no data is retained. Any information you enter into the Application remains solely on your device until you remove it or uninstall the Application.
        </p>

        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. Since our Applications do not collect data, there is no mechanism by which we would obtain information from children. If a parent or guardian believes their child has entered sensitive information into an Application and wishes to remove it, they need only uninstall the Application or delete that data from the device.
        </p>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>
            We are committed to safeguarding any information that remains on your device, but because we do not transmit or store your data, the security of your personal information relies on the security measures of your device and any third-party services you may use to share information generated in the app.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. Any updates will be posted on this page. Your continued use of the Application after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <h2>Your Consent</h2>
        <p>
            By using our New School Army Applications, you consent to the local processing of any user-driven information within the Application on your device. “Processing” includes using, storing, or otherwise handling the information locally on your device without transmission to us.
        </p>

        <h2>Contact Us</h2>
        <p>
