        <h1>OPSEC Statement</h1>
        <p>
            We understand the importance of Operations Security (OPSEC) in maintaining the safety and effectiveness of military operations. This statement outlines our commitment to OPSEC principles and provides guidance for users of our applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Source Materials and Content</h2>
        <p>
            All content within our applications is derived exclusively from publicly available, open-source materials. This includes Army doctrine, field manuals, technical manuals, and other unrestricted military publications. We strictly avoid incorporating any classified, sensitive, or controlled unclassified information (CUI) in our applications.
        </p>

        <h2>Zero Data Collection Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Our applications are designed with a strict zero data collection policy. We do not collect, transmit, or store any user data on external servers. All information entered into our applications remains solely on the user's device. This design choice not only protects user privacy but also eliminates potential OPSEC vulnerabilities that could arise from data transmission and storage.
        </p>

        <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
        <p>
            While we maintain strict OPSEC standards in our application development, users bear the responsibility for how they use these tools and what data they store within our tools. Users should:
        </p>
        <p>
            • Ensure any information they store on their devices complies with military security classifications and handling requirements<br>
            • Never input classified information into any New School Army apps<br>
            • Maintain appropriate physical security of their devices when applications contain mission-related information<br>
            • Regularly review and delete stored information that is no longer needed
        </p>

        <h2>Device Security</h2>
        <p>
            Users should implement appropriate device security measures, including:
        </p>
        <p>
            • Maintaining current device operating systems and security updates<br>
            • Using strong device passwords or biometric locks<br>
            • Enabling device encryption where available<br>
            • Implementing automatic device locking after periods of inactivity<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Operational Usage Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
            When using our applications in operational environments, users should:
        </p>
        <p>
            • Follow unit guidance regarding use of mobile devices and applications<br>
            • Never rely solely on our applications for mission-critical functions<br>
            • Maintain OPSEC awareness regarding device locations and usage patterns<br>
            • Consider operational security implications before sharing any application-generated content<br>
            • Immediately report any security concerns to appropriate unit personnel
        </p>

        <h2>Regular Review and Updates</h2>
        <p>
            We regularly review and update our applications to ensure continued compliance with Army OPSEC requirements. However, users should:
        </p>
        <p>
            • Keep applications updated to receive the latest security improvements<br>
            • Regularly review their stored data for OPSEC compliance<br>
            • Stay informed about changes in Army OPSEC policies and requirements<br>
        </p>

        <h2>Contact and Reporting</h2>
        <p>
            If you identify potential OPSEC concerns related to our applications, please contact us at polemics@newschoolarmy.com with non-sensitive details
        </p>
        <p>
            Remember: OPSEC is a shared responsibility. While we maintain strict standards in our application development, the security of military information ultimately depends on vigilant users making informed decisions about how and when to use these tools.
